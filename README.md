Purpose

The purpose of this task is to refactor the code that we created in the module this week, so that it works efficiently with a larger data set of stocks.

Background

Steve is looking to do more stock market research for his parents. He would like to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market. Steve would like to expand the amount of years that I research. This has resulted in a significant increase in data, making it more important to make the code run faster and more efficient.

Results

Stock Performance Between 2017 and 2018

Refactored Code

In 2017, 9 out 12 stocks had positive rates of return. In 2018, only had 8 out of 12 had positive rates of return. Base on the results 2017 had a good year of returns , where as in 2018, the market drop and resulted in only 8 stocks having positive returns.


Summary

Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code

Advantages

    • Better ability to preform maintenance, and adjust scale of the code.
    • Removed redundancies and duplications improve the effectiveness of the code.
    • The code uses less memory and computing power


Disadvantages

    •Refactoring the code can create errors that will require more time to fix.
    •n the case of larger teams working on refactoring, the coordination effort required could be surprisingly high.
    •An improved code is often difficult for the customer to recognize, since the functionality stays the same, so the benefit is not always seen.


Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code Vs The Original Code

I found the Refactored Code easier to write and had less issues debugging. AS with the Original had to figure out hot to write it and what goes where and the best way to get the imformation needed. After running the test I found something strange with my findings. The original performed better the the refactored code. I also got different results for 2017 stock returns.

Conclusion

In this week challenge, I had to refactor VBA code to loop through all the data at one time in order to collect the same information that was collected using the original code. I had to determine whether or not refactoring my code successfully made the VBA script run faster, or did it not make a difference. Lastly, I presented a written analysis that explains my findings and process. It took sometime to improve the code. The code does run a little slower but does provide the correct data and more efficient, concise and easy to follow. So I do think it was well worth the time to refactor this code making it better for Steve.
